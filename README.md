# AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot

This project is a simple AI-powered chatbot that provides supportive responses for mental health support. Built using Python and Streamlit, it responds to users with empathetic messages based on their input.

## Features
- Provides comforting responses to user input.
- Recognizes certain keywords to give specific responses for words like "sad," "anxious," or "nervous."
- Randomized supportive responses for general inputs.
